          The End is Nigh!! We must follow our divine leader Dr. Phil McGraw. He
          said TODAY IS GOING TO BE A CHANGING DAY IN OUR LIVES, we must act
          NOW! This plague has been brought upon us because he is tired of
          putting up with your bullshit! We must band together and prepare for
          the end times. JOIN US and become a child of Dr. Phil and Robin
          McGraw.
